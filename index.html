      <h1>General Info:</h1>
      <p>I'm a media production major focused primarily on photography and sound design/music production.</p>
      <p>Ten years ago, I graduated high school in the suburbs of Indianapolis, IN, and began school in state</p>
      <p>at IU in Bloomington. For the next two years, I studied germanic linguistics and german literature,</p>
      <p>which ultimately ended in dropping out of school. Not to go too into detail, but the whole turn of events</p>
      <p>really came down to having no clue where I wanted to go with my life after school ended.</p>
      <p>Enter CU in the Fall of 2018.</p>
      <p>After years away from school working low-paying jobs, I finally had somewhat of a lightbulb moment. What I</p>
      <p>wanted was to create, and to work with and around all of the incredible emerging technologies which were shaping</p>
      <p>the narrative around the future, and building and destroying entire industries in their wake-- I don't mean this</p>
      <p>in an exclusively bad way, such technologies are likely to be what allows for a better world one of these days.</p>
      <p>Anyways, the most fundamental component of who I am is curiosity, and I feel that media production, coding, and</p>
      <p>the creation and development of more effective technology is crucial to shaping the impact I want to have on the</p>
      <p>world at large.<p>
