    <h2>Invention</h2>
    <p>The saxophone was invented by Adolphe Sax in Belgium in the mid-19th century. It was created as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodwind_instrument#:~:text=Woodwind%20instruments%20are%20a%20family,(otherwise%20called%20reed%20pipes)." target="_blank">woodwind instrument</a>
    - similar to a clarinet- but made entirely out of brass. Sax had previously been focused on making bass clarinets, and improved their design in order to extend their
    lower range and improve their acoustic qualities. It was his work on bass clarinets and another instrument, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophicleide" target="_blank">ophicleide</a>,
    which ultimately led him to his creation of the saxophone. For context, the bass clarinet, saxophone, and ophicleide are pictured below:</p>

    <h2>Adoption and Application</h2>
    <p>After a brief period of orchestral experimentation, the saxophone was ultimately abandoned in such compositions. It wasn't until later that it began to catch on in the United States,
    primarily used in military bands. It suited this application well, because it projects sound better than a more traditional woodwind like a clarinet or flute, and- this is speculation on my part- its brass construction
    made it much more durable in the field than those instruments as well. Over time, and as music evolved, the saxophone grew into the central fixture of newer musical styles such as jazz and those styles derived from jazz.
    Today, it enjoys its place as a popular instrument in many styles of music, and doesn't appear to be going anywhere any time soon.</p>
